# Duplicate-Frequency-Analyzer
This script processes a CSV file containing integers, counts the occurrences of each number, and identifies duplicates. It outputs a sorted list of duplicate numbers and their frequencies to a new CSV file. Numbers with only one occurrence are excluded. It is designed for command-line usage with two arguments: the input file and the output file.
